I'm currently a regular member of [Shrinehouse](https://www.facebook.com/shrinehouseband/) (an Amy Winehouse tribute) and a guest with [Lowest of the Low](http://lowestofthelow.com/).

Sometimes I play with [Ron Hawkins & The Do Good Assassins](https://www.ronhawkins.com/music/type/do-good-assassins/), [Andrew Barker's Gunslinger Five](andrewbarker.bandcamp.com/album/gunslinger), [Bookchop](http://bookchop.bandcamp.com/), XLNS, and [Cedarstrip Rocketship](https://cedarstriprocketship.bandcamp.com/), and sometimes with other people too.
